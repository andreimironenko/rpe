<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
RPE 1.00.00.12 is a EA release of RPE
1.00.00.<br>
<br>
RPE is a lightweight remote processor execute engine. It allows linux
programs to call into algorithms running on the DSP. More information
is present in the docs/ directory. This document provides information
on how to build, install RPE libraries and run the RPE AAC-LC example
application.
<br>

<h2><a name="Building">Building RPE</a></h2>
<p> The first step you will need to do to build RPE is to look
at <b><i>env.mk</i></b> in the <b><i>makerules/</i></b>
directory. This contains all the environment variables and dependent
package directory paths. The directory path to each of the dependent
packages needs to be updated. 
</p>
<p> Once you finish editing the file, you can verify your changes
point to the right paths by running <b><i>make .show-products</i></b>
in the RPE toplevel directory.
</p>
<p> Once you are satisfied with the changes made, to build the RPE
libraries and examples, run <b><i>make all</i></b> in the RPE
directory. All the libraries and binaries will be generated in the
<b><i>lib</i></b> directory. Help for additional build targets can
be found by running <b><i>make help</i></b>.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Installing">Installing RPE Libraries and Examples</a></h2>
<p> Running <b><i>make install</i></b> will install RPE header files,
libraries, example applications and DSP binaries. You can change the
staging directory where these are installed by overriding
the <b><i>DESTDIR</i></b> variable.
<hr>
<h2><a name="Running">Running Examples</a></h2>
<p> The current version of RPE comes with examples that shows how
TI's AAC-LC Decoder, AAC-LC Encoder and MP3 Decoder can be integrated with RPE.
<p> First we need to make sure that the DSP binaries for the example
is loaded. Use the Firmware Loader to load the DSP Binary.
</p>
<p> Next, we run the AAC-LC Decoder example with path to the config
file having the example parameters. A sample of the configuration file
and an AAC-LC encoded file are found in the aac-lc decoder example
directory.
</p>
For the AAC-LC and MP3 decoder, the sample configuration file contains the
following parameters:
<br>
<pre>
Playback mode             # 0 -> write to file, 1 -> ALSA playback
Desired channel mode      # 0 -> mono, 1 -> stereo          
Input file name
Output file name
</pre>
<br>
For the AAC-LC encoder, the configuration file contains the parameters:
<br>
<pre>
Input mode              # 0 -> File based input, 1 -> ALSA capture
Number of Channels      # 1 -> mono, 2-> stereo
Sample rate             # Sample rate of the input pcm file.
Bitrate                 # Encoder bitrate
Input file name
Output file name
</pre>
<br>
<br><b>Note:</b> For wav files, samplerate and number of channels are taken from 
wave header irrespective of the value entered by user.
<hr>
<h2><a name="Testcases">Running Testcases</a></h2>
<p> The current version of RPE comes with test cases that uses the speech copy 
codec to use the RPE framework. The test cases currently in the package are:
<br> 
1) Measuring the time taken for the process calls for the copy codec. The macro 
NUMBER_OF_TIMES is used to define the number of process calls to be made. This 
test case could be run by:
<pre>
         target # ./test1_a8host_debug.xv5T
</pre>
2) Running multiple threads of the RPE instances for the speech copy codec. 
Currently, the macro MAX_NUM_OF_THREADS is set to 8 in the code. To run the test
cases use the command:
<pre>
         target # ./test2_a8host_debug.xv5t -n numberofthreads
</pre>
<br><b>Note:</b> By default the test cases would not be compiled in the RPE 
package. To compile the test cases, enable the macro RPE_USETESTCODEC in 
makerules/env.mk file.
